# Uber Data Analysis Project

This project involves analyzing Uber ride data to understand booking trends, user behavior, and patterns over time. The analysis is performed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook, and focuses on answering several business questions through data exploration and visualization.

## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced, aesthetically pleasing visualizations

## Project Overview

The analysis includes cleaning the dataset, processing data for insights, and creating visualizations to answer the following questions:

1. **In which category do people book Uber the most?**
   - Identifying the most frequently used ride categories.
   
2. **For what purpose do people book Uber the most?**
   - Exploring the reasons behind ride bookings.

3. **At what time do people book Uber the most?**
   - Analyzing the peak times for ride bookings during the day.

4. **In which months do people book Uber less frequently?**
   - Understanding seasonal trends in Uber bookings.

5. **On which days of the week do people book Uber the most?**
   - Analyzing weekly patterns in ride bookings.

6. **How many miles do people usually book a cab through Uber?**
   - Exploring the typical distance covered by Uber rides.

## Data Cleaning Process

1. **Handling Duplicates**: All duplicate records were removed to ensure data accuracy.
2. **Data Types**: Corrected data types for columns such as dates to facilitate proper analysis.
3. **New Columns Added**: Date, Time, Day of Week, Month

## Visualizations

Visualizations were created using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to showcase the analysis clearly and effectively. The charts and graphs help to provide insights into user behavior, peak booking times, and more.



## Conclusion

This project offers insights into Uber ride booking patterns, helping to understand peak usage times, preferred ride categories, and distances traveled. The analysis reveals valuable information that can be useful for understanding customer behavior and improving Uber services.
